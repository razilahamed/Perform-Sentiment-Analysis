# Perform Sentiment Analysis with scikit-learn

This project was completed as a guided project on Coursera, and a certificate was obtained upon completion. The project focused on sentiment analysis using various machine learning models available in scikit-learn.


## Project Overview


The main objectives of the project were:

- Text Data Preprocessing: The project involved extensive text data preprocessing, including word tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and handling stop words to prepare the text data for sentiment analysis.
- Modeling: Several machine learning models were utilized for sentiment analysis, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models were selected due to their effectiveness in text classification tasks.
- Model Comparison: The performance of each model was evaluated and compared to determine the most suitable model for sentiment analysis in the given context. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used for evaluation.
- Grid Search: Hyperparameter tuning was performed using Grid Search to optimize the performance of the models.

## Technologies Used
